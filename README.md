# Fancy-Deployment
Deploy contracts with constructor inputs using assembly

Run `npm install`.

Run `testrpc` in another terminal.

Run `truffle test` to review deployed contract with new constructor argument. 

To Do - Write script to grab contract code, so that it doesn't have to be deployed during tests to get bytecode.
